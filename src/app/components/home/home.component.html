    <summary>About Us</summary>
    <hr />
    <p>Our story begins in a hospital, when you or your family, relative or friend admitted to hospital what is the doctors advice for the diet ‘’something liquid food which is also nutritious’’. For immediate source do you find anything in the hospital which is nutritious wholesome and economical, “no right’’ and thus we started thinking over it what could be done to fix this problem. With research of 3 years we came with idea of our soup master with a vision of catering a herbal nutritious soup, we developed six different flavour soup with different health benefits and we combined technology with our soup.More than financial aspect our idea was to benefit the patients with our soups. The three years of research was not so easy, it was rollarcoaster ride. It took  hours together to clear the bugs make the function smooth and user interface friendly. The biggest chalenge was to tailor the recipes of soup which took almost six month. When the aspect was to serve it patients we promised ourselves that we never use msg , preservative and other chemicals as long as we are in the business we never compromise with quality and also in the ethics.</p>
